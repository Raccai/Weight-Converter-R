# What is this Weight Converter?🔃
To see the project in action, check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/Weight-Converter-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/Weight-Converter-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/Weight-Converter-R/). <br /><br />

The Weight Converter found on the site converts a weight from one unit to 5 other units. The available units are as follows: 
-Ounces
-Kilograms
-Grams
-Stones
-Tons
-Pounds

#Okay, but how to use? 😩
Using it is simple! Simply click any of the input fields--or hit TAB on your keyboard to focus any of them--and type in the weight you want converted. <br /><br /> 

The conversions will show on the rest of the input fields for you to see! If you want to reset everything back to 0 for a clean slate, simply click the **big red button** at the bottom of the card body or type in 0 in any of the input fields.

## How to run? 😭
If you want to run it on your own, clone this repo into your machine and install the necessary dependencies by inputting the following code in the command line while in your cloned version: <br />

```
npm install
```

When that's done, input the following code: <br />

```
npm run dev
```
With that you're good to go. Get converting!🔃⌨️😶‍🌫️
